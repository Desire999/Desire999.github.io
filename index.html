                            <p> We introduce the concept of empathy to symmetric Markov games where agents are able to reason the
                                evaluations and behaviours of other agents through their own models. Considering the mutual reasoning
                                between agents, the impact of empathy could be recursive. We propose a Q learning method with multi-level
                                empathetic reasoning for both competitive and cooperative environments.</p>
                            <p> We test our algorithm on a simple math game and <a href="https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent">MAgent</a>. Our experiments demonstrate that empathetic reasoning improves the performance of standard Q-learners.
                                In cooperative environment, we can achieve the optimal solutions with the fastest speed. In competitive
                                environment, empathetic Q learners can easily defeat learners with only local rewards or only global rewards.</p>

                            <p>We develop a system to characterize Internet hosts using deep learning, leveraging Internet
                                scan data to produce numerical and lightweight representations of hosts. To do so, we first extract
                                binary tags from semi-structured texts collected from <a href="https://censys.io/"> Censys </a> then use the variational autoencoder (VAE) to construct
                                low-dimensional embeddings of our high-dimensional binary representations which do not rely
                                on specific applications. This universality makes the embeddings broadly applicable to a variety
                                of learning tasks whereby they can be used as input features. We present two such examples,
                                detecting and predicting malicious hosts, and unmasking hidden host attributes.</p>
                            <p> Comparing the trained models in their performance, speed, and robustness, we show that our embeddings
                                reports competitive performance compared with binary representations and can achieve
                                high accuracy for these learning tasks, while drastically reducing memory and computational
                                requirements for large-scale analysis.</p>

                            <p>As the live video streaming grows rapidly, high-speed data transmission in the open field is increasingly demanding for high-quality video transmission. In this project, we proposed an innovate parallel data transmission system which combines Cellular network with wifi-hotspot to achieve high data transmission bandwidth.</p>
                            <p>Link aggregation is the primary idea underlying this system: the host device uses a Wi-Fi hotspot to connect several relay device. Then it is able to utilize the high bandwidth of Wi-Fi hotpot and transmit data with the Cellular links of all the devices in this system.</p>
                            <p>I developed the high-speed parallel transmission system as a real-world prototype system on the Android platform. I evaluated the system in real-world with 4 GigaBytes data transmission and gained 2.5X bandwidth with 4 devices.</p>

                            <p>Visual video and natural language understanding are two of the main efforts enabling computers to "think like humans". Video clip retrieval by natural language is an interdisciplinary task of these two fields. Its goal is: given a video and a query sentence, find the clip in the video described by the sentence.</p>
                            <p>In this project, we proposed a spatial-textual coattention network to establish the interactions between words and spatial regions. We evaluated our model on the DiDeMo dataset and outperformed state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.</p>

                        I currently believe in rationality and emotional neutrality. I said "currently" because I also believe in lifelong development. Amazed by the beauty in logic and infinite possibility, I chose computer science as my major. Deciding to devote my life to an area I love, I have explored different areas of computer science, namely, artificial intelligence, computer networks, programming languages, and parallel computing in chronological order. In the process of my exploration, I found my interest gradually converging to computer systems and very likely programming languages and parallel computing. I am now applying for CS Ph.D. programs starting in Fall 2020.
